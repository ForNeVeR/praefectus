Configuration
=============

Praefectus is configured in an unorthodox way: instead of a configuration file
in some external format, it is configured via the user code. You should write a
.NET program that will pass the configuration object to the Praefectus
infrastructure, or, in case you have special needs, you may invoke the
underlying API directly.

So, technically, Praefectus is a .NET library that should be used in an
application to make it work.

See an example F# application in the [`Praefectus.Example`
project][praefectus.example].

Creating a new Praefectus application should be as simple as

```console
$ dotnet new --type console --language F# -o MyTodoList
$ cd MyTodoList
$ dotnet add package Praefectus
```

The application code should then invoke the `Praefectus.Console.EntryPoint.run`
static method (see the method and arguments documentation for details). After
that, you may start Praefectus via the following shell command:

```console
$ dotnet run -- --help # to run the app and pass the --help option to Praefectus
```

The main configuration object you pass to Praefectus has type
`Praefectus.Console.Configuration`, and it contains all the information about
your data and the actions you want Praefectus to perform.

Logging Configuration
---------------------

Praefectus uses the [Serilog][serilog] logging library. It may be configured via
the `LoggerConfiguration` property of the `Environment` object passed to the
entry point.
