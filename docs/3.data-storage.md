Data Storage
============

By default, Praefectus stores its tasks and other information in a set of
Markdown files (according to the [CommonMark specification][commonmark]), each
prepended with an optional [YAML Front Matter][yaml-front-matter] block.

When reading the database directory, Praefectus will try to infer some of the
task attributes from the task file names and Markdown content; though, any
attributes (including the ones that are read from the file name) may be
overridden by the front matter block.

File name scheme is the following: `[order.]<id>[.name].md`.

If the first Markdown block in the file is a level 1 heading, then its contents
will be read as the task title. Everything else in the file is read as the task
description.

Here's an example task file (say, `42.my-task.md`):

```markdown
---
depends-on: [123, 456]
---
# Task Title
Some task description.
```

This task has the following explicit attributes:
- `id`: `my-task`
- `order`: `42`
- `title`: `Task Title`
- `dependsOn`: `[123, 465]` (a list with two task ids)
- `description`: `Some task description.`

When processing the tasks, Praefectus may change their attributes, which will
then be mirrored by changing the file contents or names.
