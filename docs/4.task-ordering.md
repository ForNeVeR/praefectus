Task Ordering
=============
One of the Praefectus features is its ability to reorder the existing tasks. To
do it, just run the `order` command.

The command will apply the order specified using the ordering configuration.
Every configuration item declares a group of tasks that should be places on a
particular place. If, say, you want to see tasks starting from a word
"important" first, then you're supposed to use the following ordering settings:

```fsharp
let config = {
    // …
    Ordering = [|
        fun t -> t.Name.Value.StartsWith("important")
        fun other -> true
    |]
}
```

This will move every "important" task before every other one by changing
the `order` attribute of these tasks.

When applying the order, Praefectus strives to perform a minimal set of changes
(since any order change usually leads to a file rename on disk), so it will
keep gaps in task orders, if they appear after applying the required ordering.
